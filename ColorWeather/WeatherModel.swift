/// The full response object is structured as such:
/// * weather (more info Weather condition codes)
///     * weather.id: Weather condition id
///     * weather.main: Group of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme, Clouds etc.)
///     * weather.description: Weather condition within the group
///     * weather.icon: Weather icon id
///
